The Others (Contenders)
=======================

As it happens in open source, Delta Lake is not alone. The following is a list of other open source projects that seems to compete or simply cover the same use cases.

Apache Iceberg
--------------

`Apache Iceberg`_ is an open table format for huge analytic datasets. Iceberg adds tables to Presto and Spark that use a high-performance format that works just like a SQL table.

Apache Hudi
-----------

`Apache Hudi`_ ingests and manages storage of large analytical datasets over DFS (HDFS or cloud stores) and provides three logical views for query access.
